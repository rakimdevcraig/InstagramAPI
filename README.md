How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

Our app was built to send users to instagram and once they are properly authenticated they will be redirected to our app and they will be shown pictures based on their location coordinates if they've posted nearby.

Optimizations:
I would like to add the ability for users to also see pictures their friends posted nearby if possible.

Lessons Learned:
I learned it is hard to deal with instagram's API but I learned how to do that so I might incorporate it into other projects. I also learned what the Oauthflow is and why some third party APIS require authentication. I also learned how to let the user allow me to get certain data from them in this case their location.
